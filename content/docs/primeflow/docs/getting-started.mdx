Get up and running with Primeflow in 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Visit [dashboard.primeflow.com](https://dashboard.primeflow.com)
2. Sign up with your email (we'll send a magic link)
3. Complete the onboarding questionnaire
4. Your organization is created automatically

## Step 2: Get Your API Keys

1. Go to **Settings → API Keys** in the dashboard
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Name your key (e.g., "Production Backend")
4. Select scopes:
   - `payments:read` — View payments
   - `payments:write` — Create/refund payments
   - `connections:read` — View PSP connections
   - `connections:write` — Manage PSP connections
5. Copy your key — **it's only shown once!**

Your key looks like: `pfk_live_a1b2c3d4e5f6...`

## Step 3: Connect a Payment Provider

Before accepting payments, connect your PSP account credentials.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.primeflow.com/v1/connections \
  -H "X-Primeflow-Key: pfk_live_xxx" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: org_123" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: conn-paystack-001" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "paystack_live",
    "provider": "paystack",
    "mode": "live",
    "status": "active",
    "credentials": {
      "secret_key": "sk_live_xxx",
      "public_key": "pk_live_xxx"
    },
    "capabilities": {
      "methods": ["card", "momo"],
      "countries": ["GH", "NG"]
    }
  }'
```

## Step 4: Create Your First Payment

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.primeflow.com/v1/payments/intents \
  -H "X-Primeflow-Key: pfk_live_xxx" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: org_123" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: order-12345" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 5000,
    "currency": "GHS",
    "method": "momo",
    "country": "GH",
    "customer_id": "cust_456",
    "metadata": {
      "order_id": "12345"
    }
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "pay_abc123",
  "status": "requires_action",
  "provider": "hubtel",
  "connection_id": "hubtel_live",
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "GHS"
}
```

## Step 5: Handle the Response

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `pending` | Awaiting processing | Wait for webhook |
| `requires_action` | Customer action needed | Show OTP/prompt |
| `succeeded` | Payment complete | Fulfill order |
| `failed` | Payment failed | Show error |

## Step 6: Set Up Webhooks

Receive real-time payment notifications:

1. Go to **Settings → Webhooks** in dashboard
2. Enter your endpoint URL
3. Select events to receive
4. Copy the signing secret

See [Webhooks Guide](./webhooks) for implementation details.

## Required Headers

Every API request needs these headers:

| Header | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `X-Primeflow-Key` | Your API key | `pfk_live_xxx` |
| `X-Org-Id` | Your organization ID | `org_123` |
| `Idempotency-Key` | Unique request ID | `order-12345` |
| `Content-Type` | Always JSON | `application/json` |

## Test Mode

Use test credentials to develop without real money:
- Test API keys start with `pfk_test_`
- Use sandbox PSP credentials
- Payments are simulated
