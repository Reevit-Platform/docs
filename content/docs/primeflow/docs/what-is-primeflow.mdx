# What is Reevit?

Reevit is a **unified payments, billing, and orchestration API for Africa**. We solve the complexity of managing multiple payment service providers (PSPs) across different African markets by providing one simple API that handles routing, failover, webhooks, and recurring billing.

## The Problem We Solve

African businesses face unique challenges when accepting payments:

### Fragmented Payment Landscape

- **Multiple PSPs per market**: Each country has different payment providers (Paystack, Hubtel, Flutterwave, Monnify, M-Pesa, Stripe)
- **Different APIs**: Each provider has unique endpoints, request formats, and response structures
- **Inconsistent webhooks**: Different event formats and verification methods
- **Manual failover**: When one provider fails, you must manually switch to another
- **No unified billing**: Recurring subscriptions require separate integrations per provider

### Developer Friction

- **Complex integrations**: Building and maintaining integrations for multiple PSPs is time-consuming
- **Error handling**: Each provider has different error codes and retry logic
- **Testing complexity**: Testing across multiple sandbox environments
- **Documentation sprawl**: Keeping track of multiple API documentation sites

### Business Challenges

- **Higher failure rates**: Single points of failure when a provider goes down
- **Lost revenue**: Failed payments due to provider outages
- **Operational overhead**: Managing multiple PSP accounts, credentials, and dashboards
- **Limited visibility**: No unified view of payment performance across providers

## Our Solution

Reevit provides **one API** that abstracts away the complexity:

### ✅ One API for All Providers

A single, consistent API that works across all payment providers. No need to learn different APIs or handle provider-specific quirks.

### ✅ Smart Routing & Failover

Automatically routes payments to the best provider based on:
- **Success rates** — Historical performance data
- **Latency** — Response times
- **Fees** — Cost optimization
- **Availability** — Real-time health monitoring

If a provider fails, Reevit automatically tries the next available connection.

### ✅ Unified Webhooks

Receive normalized webhook events from all providers in one consistent format. No more parsing different event structures.

### ✅ Built-in Subscriptions

Automated recurring billing with dunning (retry logic) and invoice management. Works across all your connected providers.

### ✅ Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Connect your own PSP accounts. You maintain direct relationships with providers while benefiting from Reevit's orchestration layer.

### ✅ Comprehensive Dashboard

One dashboard to manage:
- All your PSP connections
- Payment analytics across providers
- Webhook configurations
- Subscription management
- Fraud policies and routing rules

```

1. **You make one API call** to Reevit with payment details
2. **Reevit routes intelligently** to the best available provider
3. **If a provider fails**, Reevit automatically tries the next one
4. **You receive unified webhooks** regardless of which provider processed the payment

## Key Concepts

### Organizations

Each Primeflow account has an **organization** that contains:
- API keys
- PSP connections
- Payment history
- Subscriptions
- Webhook configurations

### Connections

A **connection** represents your credentials for a specific PSP account. You can have multiple connections per provider (e.g., one for Ghana, one for Nigeria).

### Payments

A **payment** represents a single transaction attempt. Primeflow handles routing, retries, and webhooks automatically.

### Subscriptions

A **subscription** automates recurring billing. Primeflow creates invoices and charges customers on schedule with automatic retry logic.

### Routing Rules

**Routing rules** let you explicitly control which provider handles payments from specific countries or payment methods.

### Webhooks

**Webhooks** notify your application when payment events occur. All providers send events in the same unified format.
