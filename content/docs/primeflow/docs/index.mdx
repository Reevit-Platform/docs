# Introduction

Reevit is the unified payment orchestration platform built for African businesses. We abstract the complexity of integrating multiple payment providers (Paystack, Hubtel, Stripe, etc.) into a single, powerful API.

## Why Reevit?

Integrating payments in Africa is fragmented. You have to deal with:
- **Multiple APIs**: Different request/response formats for every provider
- **Maintenance Hell**: Constant API updates and breaking changes
- **Failures**: No easy way to failover when a provider goes down
- **Complex Reporting**: scattered data across multiple dashboards

**Reevit solves this** by giving you:
- **One API**: Connect once, access all providers
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically route payments to the best provider
- **Auto-Failover**: Zero downtime payment processing
- **Unified Data**: Single source of truth for all transactions
