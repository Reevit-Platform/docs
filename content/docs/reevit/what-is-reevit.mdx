# What is Reevit?

Reevit is a **unified payment orchestration platform** designed specifically for the unique challenges of African commerce. We provide a single API that connects you to every major payment provider across the continent, automating the complexity of routing, failover, and reconciliation.

## 🚀 The Value Proposition

We built Reevit to serve two distinct needs: growing your business and simplifying your engineering.

### 🏢 For Business Leaders
*   **Revenue Rescue**: Stop losing sales when a provider goes down. Reevit automatically fails over to a backup provider in real-time.
*   **Global Reach, Local Feel**: Accept Mobile Money (M-Pesa, MoMo), Bank Transfers, and Cards across 5+ countries with one contract.
*   **Direct Ownership (BYOK)**: Use your own PSP keys. You keep your direct relationships with providers like Paystack or Stripe while we handle the technical orchestration.
*   **Operational Clarity**: Unified analytics across all providers. No more logging into five different dashboards to see your daily sales.

### 💻 For Developers
*   **One API, Infinite Providers**: Write code once. Our standardized API abstracts away the quirks, different response formats, and error codes of 10+ PSPs.
*   **Unified Webhooks**: Receive normalized event notifications. Whether it's a card payment from Nigeria or M-Pesa from Kenya, the payload format stays the same.
*   **SDK-First Experience**: Fully typed SDKs in TypeScript, Python, Go, and PHP. Integration takes minutes, not weeks.
*   **Built-in Reliability**: Automatic retries, signature verification, and idempotency are handled at the platform level.

## 🛠️ How It Works

Reevit sits between your application and your payment providers, acting as an intelligent conductor for every transaction.

![Smart Routing](/images/routing/smart-logic.png)

1.  **Unified Request**: Your application sends a single payment intent to Reevit.
2.  **Orchestration Engine**: Reevit evaluates your [Routing Rules](/docs/reevit/routing-rules) and provider health.
3.  **Smart Routing**: The transaction is routed to the optimal provider (based on success rates or fees).
4.  **Automatic Failover**: If the primary provider is down, Reevit instantly tries a fallback connection.
5.  **Verified Webhook**: You receive a single, verified notification once the payment is final.
