# Payment Links

Payment Links let you generate a unique URL that displays a branded checkout page. Share it via email, SMS, or embed it on your website—no coding required. Each link tracks its own stats, usage limits, and associated payments.

<Callout type="info">
  Payment Links are ideal for invoicing, donations, event tickets, or any one-off transaction where you don't want to build a custom checkout flow.

## 🎯 When to Use Payment Links

| Use Case | Why Payment Links Work |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Invoices** | Send a payment link to a client instead of chasing bank transfers. |
| **Donations** | Create a shareable donation page with optional custom amounts. |
| **Events & Tickets** | Generate a link for event registration with a fixed price. |
| **Quick Sales** | Share a link on social media for one-off product sales. |

## 📊 Tracking & Stats

Each Payment Link has its own analytics:
*   **Total Views**: How many times the checkout page was loaded.
*   **Successful Payments**: Number of completed transactions.
*   **Conversion Rate**: `Successful Payments / Total Views`.
*   **Total Revenue**: Sum of all successful payments.

Fetch stats programmatically:

```typescript
const stats = await reevit.paymentLinks.getStats('lnk_xyz123');
// { views: 150, payments: 45, conversion_rate: 0.30, total_revenue: 225000 }
```

## ✅ Best Practices

1.  **Set Expiry Dates**: For time-sensitive campaigns, always set an `expires_at` to prevent stale links.
2.  **Use Descriptive Names**: Make internal names searchable (e.g., "Invoice #1234 - Acme Corp").
3.  **Custom Branding**: Use the `branding` field to match the checkout page to your brand.
4.  **Limit Usage**: For limited promotions, set `max_uses` to control how many payments can be processed.
