# Unified Payments

Reevit Payments allows you to accept funds from customers globally via a single API. We abstract away the technical debt of integrating multiple Gateways, Mobile Money providers, and Bank Transfer systems into one standardized flow.

## 🏆 The Reevit Advantage

### 🏢 For Business Growth
*   **Maximized Acceptance**: If a card fails on one provider, we instantly retry on another. Never lose a sale to a gateway outage again.
*   **Optimized Fees**: Route transactions to providers with the lowest processing fees based on the customer's region.
*   **Unified Reporting**: View your consolidated revenue across Hubtel, Paystack, and Stripe in a single dashboard.

### 💻 For Engineering Velocity
*   **Standardized Lifecycle**: No more mapping "Success" from paystack to "Completed" from Hubtel. Every transaction follows a [unified state machine](#the-transaction-lifecycle).
*   **Developer-First SDKs**: Use our typed libraries to handle payment intents, idempotency, and error handling out of the box.
*   **One Integration**: Add a new country or payment method by simply toggling a switch in the dashboard—no code changes required.

## 🔄 The Transaction Lifecycle

Every payment on Reevit follows a secure, 5-step lifecycle:

1.  **Intent Created**: Your server requests a [Payment Intent](#creating-a-payment).
2.  **Smart Routing**: Reevit selects the optimal connection based on your [Routing Rules](/docs/reevit/docs/routing-rules).
3.  **Customer Action**: The customer completes the required action (OTP, PIN, or 3DS).
4.  **Transaction Finalized**: The PSP confirms success to Reevit.
5.  **Verified Webhook**: Your application receives a [standardized notification](/docs/reevit/docs/webhooks) to fulfill the order.

## 🛠️ Implementation

### Creating a Payment Intent

To start a transaction, use the `create` method in the SDK. This reserves the payment and returns a `client_secret` if frontend action is needed.

```typescript
import { Reevit } from '@reevit/node';

const payment = await reevit.payments.create({
  amount: 1000,           // 10.00 GHS
  currency: 'GHS',
  method: 'card',         // 'card', 'momo', or 'bank'
  country: 'GH',
  customer_id: 'user_1',
  metadata: { cart_id: '99' }
});

// Response status: 'requires_action' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'
```

### Handling Next Actions

If a payment requires user input (like a 3D Secure redirect or a Mobile Money prompt), the status will be `requires_action`.

*   **Redirect**: For cards, the SDK provides a URL to redirect the user to finish the secure check.
*   **Asynchronous (MoMo)**: For mobile money, the payment stays in a `processing` state until the customer approves the prompt on their phone.

## ✅ Best Practices

1.  **Always use Idempotency**: Provide an `idempotency_key` (like an Order ID) to prevent double-charging customers during network retries.
2.  **Fulfill on Webhooks**: Never fulfill an order based solely on a frontend redirect. Wait for the `payment.succeeded` [webhook event](/docs/reevit/docs/webhooks).
3.  **Use Test Mode**: Develop your integration using `sk_test_` keys to simulate different success and failure scenarios.
