# Getting Started

Welcome to Reevit. Whether you are a business owner looking to automate your billing or a developer building the next big fintech app, this guide will get you live in minutes.

## 🏢 Step 1: Business Onboarding (No-Code)

Before writing any code, you need to set up your business environment in the [Reevit Dashboard](https://dashboard.reevit.com).

1.  **Create your Organization**: Sign up and name your organization (e.g., "Acme Corp").
2.  **Connect a Provider**: Navigate to **Connections** and add your first PSP (e.g., Paystack or Stripe). This is our "Bring Your Own Key" model.
3.  **Configure a Workflow**: Go to **Workflows** and set up a simple "Slack Notification" for successful payments so your team stays informed.

## 💻 Step 2: Developer Setup

Once your organization is ready, it's time to integrate the Reevit API.

### 1. Get your API Keys
Navigate to **Settings → API Keys**. You will need your `Secret Key` (starts with `sk_live_`) and your `Organization ID`.

### 2. Install the SDK
We recommend using our official SDKs for the best experience, including automatic retries and type safety.

```bash
# TypeScript / Node.js
npm install @reevit/node

# Python
pip install reevit
```

---

## 💳 Step 3: Process a Payment

Here is how you create a simple payment intent using our SDK.

```typescript
import { Reevit } from '@reevit/node';

const reevit = new Reevit(process.env.REEVIT_SECRET_KEY);

const payment = await reevit.payments.create({
  amount: 5000,
  currency: 'GHS',
  method: 'momo',
  country: 'GH',
  customer_id: 'cust_123',
  metadata: { order_id: 'XYZ-99' }
});

console.log('Payment ID:', payment.id);
```

---

## 🔄 Step 4: Go Live with Webhooks

To keep your application in sync with real-world payment events, you must configure a Webhook.

1.  Go to **Developers → Webhooks**.
2.  Enter your endpoint URL (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com/webhooks/reevit`).
3.  Reevit will now push [standardized events](/docs/reevit/docs/webhooks) to your server regardless of which payment provider processed the transaction.
