# Test Mode

Reevit provides a complete test environment so you can develop and test your integration without processing real payments or affecting live data.

## Environment URLs

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| **Test Mode** | `https://api.reevit.com` (with test API key) |
| **Live Mode** | `https://api.reevit.com` (with live API key) |

## API Keys

Your organization has two sets of API keys:

- **Test API Keys**: Start with `sk_test_` - use these for development
- **Live API Keys**: Start with `sk_live_` - use these for production

```bash
# Test mode request
curl -X POST https://api.reevit.com/v1/payments/intents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_your_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 1000, "currency": "GHS", "method": "mobile_money"}'
```

## Test Mode Behavior

In test mode:

- ✅ **No real charges** - Payments are simulated
- ✅ **Instant webhooks** - Events fire immediately
- ✅ **Full API access** - All endpoints work identically
- ✅ **Separate data** - Test and live data are completely isolated

## Test Cards & Mobile Money

### Test Card Numbers

| Card Number | Scenario |
|-------------|----------|
| `4084084084084081` | Successful payment |
| `4000000000000002` | Card declined |
| `4000000000009995` | Insufficient funds |

### Test Mobile Money Numbers

| Phone Number | Provider | Scenario |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| `0551234567` | MTN | Successful payment |
| `0201234567` | Vodafone | Successful payment |
| `0271234567` | AirtelTigo | Successful payment |
| `0550000001` | MTN | Failed - Insufficient funds |
| `0550000002` | MTN | Failed - User cancelled |

## Switching to Live Mode

Before going live, ensure you have:

1. **Completed KYC verification** - Submit your business documents
2. **Connected live PSP credentials** - Add your production API keys from Paystack, Hubtel, etc.
3. **Tested webhook handling** - Verify your webhook endpoint processes all event types
4. **Updated API keys** - Replace test keys with live keys in your production environment

```bash
# Live mode request
curl -X POST https://api.reevit.com/v1/payments/intents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 1000, "currency": "GHS", "method": "mobile_money"}'
```

## Mode Header

You can also explicitly set the mode using the `X-Reevit-Mode` header:

```bash
# Explicitly use test mode
curl -X GET https://api.reevit.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
  -H "X-Reevit-Mode: test"
```

Valid values: `test` or `live`

## Best Practices

1. **Use test mode for development** - Never use live credentials in development
2. **Test all scenarios** - Use test numbers to simulate failures
3. **Verify webhook signatures** - Ensure your webhook handler validates signatures
4. **Test idempotency** - Verify duplicate requests are handled correctly
5. **Monitor test logs** - Check the dashboard for test transaction logs
