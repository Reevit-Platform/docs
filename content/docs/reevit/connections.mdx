# Connections (BYOK)

Reevit operates on a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model. This means you connect your existing payment service provider (PSP) accounts (like Paystack, Hubtel, or Stripe) directly to Reevit. You maintain full ownership of your funds and provider relationships while leveraging our orchestration layer for unified operations.

## 💎 The BYOK Advantage

### 🏢 For Business Strategy
*   **Direct Settlement**: Funds are settled directly into your own PSP accounts. Reevit never touches your money.
*   **Better Rates**: Negotiate your processing fees directly with providers based on your volume. We don't add markups to your transaction costs.
*   **Zero Lock-in**: Your data and customer payment tokens belong to you. If you choose to stop using Reevit, your provider accounts remain active.
*   **Unified Security**: Store all your API keys in one encrypted Vault instead of scattering them across multiple service environments.

### 💻 For Engineering Control
*   **Abstracted Credentials**: Manage multiple keys for different regions (e.g., Paystack Ghana vs. Paystack Nigeria) under a single `connection_id`.
*   **Capability Mapping**: Reevit automatically knows which connection to use based on the currency and method in the payment request.
*   **Health Monitoring**: Every connection has a real-time health score. If a provider's API starts failing, Reevit detects it and shifts traffic to your fallbacks.

## 🛠️ Setting Up a Connection

### 1. Collect your PSP Keys
Log into your provider's dashboard (e.g., Paystack Settings) and copy your **Secret Key** and **Public Key**.

### 2. Register the Connection
Use the Reevit Dashboard or API to link the keys.

```typescript
import { Reevit } from '@reevit/node';

const connection = await reevit.connections.create({
  id: 'paystack_gh_primary',
  provider: 'paystack',
  mode: 'live',
  credentials: {
    secret_key: 'sk_live_xxx',
    public_key: 'pk_live_xxx'
  },
  capabilities: {
    methods: ['card', 'momo'],
    countries: ['GH']
  }
});
```

## ✅ Best Practices

1.  **Redundancy is Key**: Always have at least two connections for your primary market (e.g., Hubtel + Paystack for Ghana). This enables [Smart Routing](/docs/reevit/routing-rules).
2.  **Environment Matching**: Ensure your `mode` (live/sandbox) matches the PSP keys you are using.
3.  **Regular Rotation**: Rotate your provider secret keys every 90 days as part of your security protocol. Reevit makes this seamless via the `update` API.
